Purge all page from W3 Total Cache when a post is published / updated.
== Description ==

Page caching mechanism is somewhat very confusing. Which page to purge ? does the archive need to purge to? how about the widget?

We know that W3 Total Cache already have mechanism to purge archive page with similiar tag / category (post term purge). However this is not sufficient.

Consider this scenario :

Web sitemap :

- Home
	- /category/category_1
	- /post_type_2
	- /pages_x(contain post_type_2 with custom WP_Query )

With normal W3 Total cache if you publish post with post_type_2 and category 1 the /pages_x  will not purge !

Our solution is to purge all the page cache during a post is marked publish.

When all page is purged ?

1. There is new post marked as publish (updated or new post)
2. Post move to trash

Setting Recomendation 

1. Do not prime/preload page cache , this will slow your site
2. Use disqus/livefrye for your comment, it will reduce page cache problem
